Compaq Visual Fortran (CVF) was a popular Fortran compiler and integrated development environment (IDE) for Windows that was developed by Compaq (formerly DEC) and later acquired by Intel. CVF was discontinued in 2003 and replaced by Intel Visual Fortran Composer XE. However, some users may still want to use CVF for legacy applications or compatibility reasons.

In this article, we will show you how to download and install CVF 6.6 on Windows 7, which is the last version of CVF that was released. We will also provide some tips and alternatives for using Fortran on modern Windows systems.
  
## Downloading CVF 6.6
 
Unfortunately, there is no legal download source for CVF 6.6, as Intel does not provide any support or distribution for this product[^1^]. If you have a valid license agreement and a license number for CVF 6.6, you may be able to find a copy of the installation CD from a third-party source, such as online auctions or software archives. However, this is not recommended as it may violate the terms of use or expose you to malware or viruses.
 
One possible source for CVF 6.6 is the Internet Archive, which has a copy of the installation CD for CVF Professional 6.5 + 6.6C Update[^2^]. This is a free and legal download, but it may not work for all users or applications. You will need to burn the ISO file to a CD or mount it as a virtual drive to install it.
  
## Installing CVF 6.6
 
To install CVF 6.6 on Windows 7, you will need to run the setup.exe file from the installation CD or ISO file in compatibility mode for Windows XP Service Pack 3. You can do this by right-clicking on the file and selecting Properties > Compatibility > Run this program in compatibility mode for > Windows XP (Service Pack 3). You may also need to run the file as an administrator by checking the Run this program as an administrator box.
 
Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation process. You will need to enter your license number when prompted. You may also need to restart your computer after the installation is finished.
  
## Using CVF 6.6
 
To use CVF 6.6 on Windows 7, you will need to launch the IDE from the Start menu or desktop shortcut in compatibility mode for Windows XP Service Pack 3 as well. You can do this by right-clicking on the icon and selecting Properties > Compatibility > Run this program in compatibility mode for > Windows XP (Service Pack 3). You may also need to run the program as an administrator by checking the Run this program as an administrator box.
 
You can then create, edit, compile, debug, and run your Fortran programs using the IDE as usual. However, you may encounter some issues or limitations when using CVF 6.6 on Windows 7, such as:
